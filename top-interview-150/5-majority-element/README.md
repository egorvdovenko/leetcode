# Majority Element

## Description
The "Majority Element" task involves finding the element that appears more than half the time in a given array of numbers. This problem can be efficiently solved using the Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm, which operates in linear time and uses constant space.

## Problem Statement
Given an array of size `n`, find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than `n/2` times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

## Best Solution Approach
The best solution for this problem is the Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm, which works as follows:
1. Initialize a candidate variable and a count variable.
2. Iterate through the array:
   - If the count is zero, set the candidate to the current element.
   - If the current element is the same as the candidate, increment the count.
   - If the current element is different, decrement the count.
3. At the end of the iteration, the candidate will be the majority element.

This algorithm runs in O(n) time and O(1) space, making it very efficient for this problem.
