# Rotate Array

The "Rotate Array" task involves rotating an array to the right by a specified number of steps. This operation modifies the array in-place, meaning that the original array is changed rather than creating a new one.

## Problem Statement

Given an array `nums` and an integer `k`, you need to rotate the array to the right by `k` steps. For example, if `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]` and `k = 3`, the result should be `[5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.

## Best Solution Approach

The optimal solution to this problem uses the concept of reversing parts of the array. The steps are as follows:

1. Reverse the entire array.
2. Reverse the first `k` elements.
3. Reverse the remaining `n - k` elements.

This approach runs in O(n) time complexity and uses O(1) extra space, making it efficient for large arrays. 

Here is the implementation of the solution in JavaScript:

```javascript
var rotate = function (nums, k) {
  k %= nums.length; // Handle cases where k is greater than the length of the array

  var reverse = function (start, end) {
    while (start < end) {
      [nums[start], nums[end]] = [nums[end], nums[start]];
      start++;
      end--;
    }
  }

  reverse(0, nums.length - 1); // Reverse the entire array
  reverse(0, k - 1); // Reverse the first k elements
  reverse(k, nums.length - 1); // Reverse the remaining elements
};
```
